## Unified CMS Routing

- [x] Created a unified dynamic route handler that checks both Payload CMS and Builder.io
- [x] Implemented metadata generation from both CMS sources
- [x] Added proper fallback handling with 404 responses
- [x] Created documentation for the unified CMS routing system
- [x] Fixed slug handling to properly query Payload CMS
- [x] Added robust error handling for Builder.io integration
- [x] Implemented fallback mechanisms for when either CMS is unavailable
- [x] Enhanced debugging to troubleshoot slug matching issues
- [x] Removed publishedAt filter to allow finding unpublished pages
- [x] Created comprehensive content management documentation
- [x] Added SecretGenerator component for generating Payload CMS secrets

## Implementation Details

The unified CMS routing system allows content to be served from either Payload CMS or Builder.io using the same URL structure. This provides flexibility in content management while maintaining a consistent URL structure for users.

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/(payload)/[...slug]/page.tsx` - Main dynamic route handler that checks both CMS systems
- `src/content/docs/ai/unified-cms-routing.mdx` - Documentation for the unified routing system
- `src/content/docs/content-management/index.mdx` - Overview of content management options
- `src/content/docs/content-management/payload.mdx` - Payload CMS documentation
- `src/content/docs/content-management/builder.mdx` - Builder.io documentation
- `src/content/docs/content-management/markdown-mdx.mdx` - Markdown and MDX documentation
- `src/components/mdx/secret-generator.tsx` - Component for generating secure secrets
- `src/mdx-components.tsx` - Updated to include the SecretGenerator component

### How It Works

1. When a user visits a URL, the dynamic route handler processes the request
2. The system first checks if the content exists in Payload CMS
   - First tries with the full slug path (joined with "/")
   - If not found, tries with just the first segment of the slug
   - If still not found, tries a more flexible "like" query
3. If found in Payload CMS, it renders using Payload's components
4. If not found in Payload CMS, it checks Builder.io (if enabled)
5. If found in Builder.io, it renders using Builder.io's components
6. If not found in either CMS, a 404 page is displayed

### Improvements Made

- Added robust error handling for Builder.io integration
- Implemented proper slug handling for Payload CMS queries
- Added fallback mechanisms for when either CMS is unavailable
- Added detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Improved metadata generation from both CMS sources
- Removed publishedAt filter to allow finding unpublished pages
- Added multiple query strategies to find content with different slug formats
- Enhanced debugging to troubleshoot slug matching issues
- Created comprehensive documentation for content management options
- Added interactive SecretGenerator component for generating secure Payload secrets

### Next Steps

- [ ] Add caching to improve performance
- [ ] Implement preview mode for both CMS systems
- [ ] Add analytics to track which CMS is serving which pages
- [ ] Create a dashboard to visualize content distribution
