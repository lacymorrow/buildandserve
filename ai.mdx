# AI Assistant Documentation

This file documents the changes made by the AI assistant to the Shipkit codebase.

## Admin Checking Logic Consolidation

- [x] Updated `src/config/site.ts` to add a warning to the client-side admin check stub
- [x] Updated `src/components/ui/user-menu.tsx` to use the `useIsAdmin` hook instead of `siteConfig.admin.isAdmin`
- [x] Updated `src/app/(app)/(admin)/layout.tsx` to use the `checkIsAdmin` server action instead of `siteConfig.admin.isAdmin`
- [x] Created documentation in `src/docs/admin-checking.md` explaining the recommended approach for admin checking

## Admin Checking Code Organization

- [x] Moved the `useIsAdmin` hook from `src/components/admin/admin-check.tsx` to `src/hooks/use-is-admin.tsx`
- [x] Deleted the original `src/components/admin/admin-check.tsx` file
- [x] Updated imports in `src/components/ui/user-menu.tsx` to use the new hook location
- [x] Updated documentation in `src/docs/admin-checking.md` to reflect the simplified approach

## Admin Checking Architecture Improvement

- [x] Created `src/server/services/admin-service.ts` with functions for server-side admin checking
- [x] Updated `src/app/(app)/(admin)/layout.tsx` to use the admin service instead of server actions
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect the proper architectural pattern:
  - Server components should use services directly
  - Client components should use server actions via hooks

### Problem

The original implementation had architectural issues:
1. Server components were using server actions for data fetching, which violates the project's architecture principles
2. The approach didn't follow the separation of concerns between services and actions
3. The code didn't align with the project's convention that "server code belongs in services, server action code belongs in actions"

### Solution

Improved the architecture by:
1. Creating a dedicated admin service for server components
2. Ensuring server components use services directly for data fetching
3. Maintaining server actions for client components
4. Updating documentation to clearly explain the architectural pattern

This approach ensures that:
- The code follows the project's architectural principles
- There's a clear separation between services and actions
- Server components use services directly for data fetching
- Client components use server actions via hooks

## Default Team Selection in Create Project Dialog

- [x] Updated `src/app/(app)/(dashboard)/projects/_components/create-project-dialog.tsx` to set a default team when creating a project

### Problem

When clicking the create project button in the app-sidebar, no team was selected by default in the team dropdown, requiring users to manually select a team every time.

### Solution

Modified the `CreateProjectDialog` component to:
1. Add a state variable to track the default team ID
2. Set the first team as the default when teams are loaded
3. Pass the default team ID to the Select component

This improvement enhances the user experience by:
- Reducing the number of clicks required to create a project
- Providing a sensible default selection
- Maintaining the ability for users to change the team if needed

## Unified Project Dialog Component

- [x] Created a new unified `ProjectDialog` component that combines the functionality of `CreateProjectDialog` and `CreateProjectAndTeamDialog`
- [x] Updated `ProjectsList` to use the new unified component
- [x] Updated `ProjectMenu` to use the new unified component
- [x] Deleted the old dialog components
- [x] Enhanced the `ProjectDialog` component to support editing existing projects
- [x] Updated the projects page to use the `ProjectDialog` component instead of `DataTableDialog`

### Problem

The codebase had multiple similar dialog components for creating projects:
1. `CreateProjectDialog` - A simple dialog for creating projects with team selection
2. `CreateProjectAndTeamDialog` - A more complex dialog that also allowed creating new teams
3. These components had duplicated code and functionality, making maintenance difficult
4. The unified component initially only supported creating projects, not editing them
5. The projects page was using a generic `DataTableDialog` component for project operations, creating inconsistency in the UI

### Solution

Created a unified `ProjectDialog` component that:
1. Uses class variance authority (CVA) to toggle features based on the `variant` prop
2. Supports both simple project creation and project creation with team creation
3. Handles default team selection automatically
4. Uses React Hook Form for form management and validation
5. Added a `mode` prop to support both "create" and "edit" operations
6. Added a `project` prop to pass the project data when in edit mode
7. Updated the UI to show appropriate titles, descriptions, and button text based on the mode
8. Only shows team selection in create mode, as team can't be changed when editing
9. Replaced the generic `DataTableDialog` in the projects page with the specialized `ProjectDialog`
10. Simplified the projects page by removing redundant state and handlers

This improvement:
- Reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Provides a consistent user experience across the application
- Makes it easier to add new features to the project creation flow in the future
- Follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Supports the full lifecycle of project management (create, edit, delete)
- Maintains a consistent UI pattern throughout the application
- Improves code organization by centralizing project-related UI logic

## Vercel Integration

- [x] Added Vercel as an OAuth provider in `src/server/auth.providers.ts`
- [x] Updated the session type in `src/server/auth.config.ts` to include accounts information
- [x] Updated the session callback to fetch and include user's connected accounts
- [x] Created a server action to disconnect provider accounts in `src/server/actions/settings.ts`
- [x] Updated the account settings page to allow connecting and disconnecting Vercel accounts
- [x] Implemented Vercel OAuth flow using the integration approach from the tutorial
- [x] Created a dedicated callback route for handling Vercel OAuth redirects
- [x] Added proper token exchange and database storage for Vercel credentials
- [x] Updated the Vercel OAuth callback URL:
  - Created a new callback route at `/connect/vercel/auth`
  - Maintained the same integration approach but with the new callback URL
  - Updated documentation in `.env.example` to reflect the new callback URL
  - Added extensive logging for debugging OAuth issues
- [x] Fixed OAuth redirect_uri issues:
  - Updated the token exchange to include the redirect_uri parameter
  - Ensured consistent redirect_uri parameter naming in authorization and token requests
  - Updated documentation to emphasize the importance of matching redirect URIs
- [x] Fixed token expiration handling:
  - Added fallback for when expires_in is undefined in the token response
  - Set a default expiration of 30 days when not provided
  - Fixed database error related to invalid integer conversion
- [x] Fixed rendering loop in account settings page:
  - Added a ref to track if URL parameters have been processed
  - Removed success/error parameters from URL after processing
  - Prevented multiple session updates on the same page load

### Problem

Users needed a way to connect their Vercel accounts to deploy projects directly from ShipKit, but the existing implementation was incomplete:
1. The Vercel OAuth provider was not properly configured
2. The UI for connecting and disconnecting Vercel accounts was missing
3. The session data didn't include information about connected accounts
4. There was no way to disconnect a Vercel account once connected
5. The initial implementation using NextAuth's built-in OAuth flow was encountering errors
6. The "Invalid client_id" error indicated issues with the OAuth configuration
7. The callback URL was not in the desired location
8. The token exchange was failing with "Invalid request: `redirect_uri` is not a valid URI" error
9. The database insertion was failing with "invalid input syntax for type integer: 'NaN'" error
10. The account settings page was experiencing an infinite rendering loop after successful connection

### Solution

Implemented a complete Vercel integration that:
1. Uses the Vercel Integration approach as described in the tutorial
2. Redirects users directly to the Vercel integration page
3. Uses the proper CSRF token approach for security
4. Handles the OAuth callback with proper error handling
5. Exchanges the authorization code for access tokens with the correct redirect_uri
6. Securely stores the OAuth tokens in the database
7. Provides proper error handling and user feedback via URL parameters
8. Implements a clean UI for connecting and disconnecting Vercel accounts
9. Uses the desired callback URL at `/connect/vercel/auth`
10. Adds extensive logging for debugging OAuth issues
11. Ensures consistent parameter naming between authorization and token requests
12. Handles missing token expiration by setting a default value
13. Prevents rendering loops by tracking processed URL parameters and cleaning up the URL

This implementation:
- Follows Vercel's recommended integration approach
- Provides a seamless user experience with direct redirects
- Securely handles authentication tokens
- Properly stores connection information in the database
- Enables users to easily connect and disconnect their Vercel accounts
- Follows security best practices for OAuth implementations
- Maintains a consistent UI with the rest of the application
- Uses the preferred URL structure for the callback endpoint
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Correctly implements the OAuth 2.0 specification requirements for redirect_uri
- Handles edge cases like missing token expiration gracefully
- Prevents UI issues like infinite rendering loops

## Vercel OAuth Integration Improvements

- [x] Fixed the Vercel OAuth integration to use the correct approach with integration slug
- [x] Updated the `VercelConnectButton` component to use the correct redirect URI parameter
- [x] Created a new callback route at `/connect/vercel/auth` to handle the OAuth flow
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling and logging in the callback route
- [x] Fixed rendering loop issue in the account settings page by properly tracking processed URL parameters
- [x] Improved URL parameter handling to prevent re-processing on page refreshes
- [x] Updated environment variables documentation to include the integration slug
- [x] Added detailed logging of OAuth parameters and token data for debugging
- [x] Created a dedicated EULA page for the Vercel ShipKit Integration
- [x] Implemented Vercel deployment functionality with conditional UI

### Problems Addressed

1. **Incorrect OAuth Flow Implementation**: The initial implementation didn't follow the tutorial's approach using the integration slug.
2. **Parameter Naming Inconsistency**: The `redirect_uri` parameter was incorrectly named in some places.
3. **Rendering Loop**: The account settings page was continuously re-rendering due to URL parameters being processed on every render.
4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The callback route needed more comprehensive error handling and logging.
5. **URL Parameter Persistence**: URL parameters weren't being properly cleared after processing, causing issues on page refreshes.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Correct OAuth Flow**: Updated the `VercelConnectButton` to use the integration slug and proper redirect approach.
2. **Consistent Parameter Naming**: Ensured consistent use of `redirect_uri` parameter throughout the codebase.
3. **State-Based Parameter Tracking**: Implemented state-based tracking of processed URL parameters to prevent re-processing.
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages.
5. **URL Cleanup**: Implemented proper URL cleanup after processing parameters to prevent issues on page refreshes.
6. **Detailed Logging**: Added detailed logging of all OAuth parameters and token data for better debugging.

## Vercel Deployment Functionality

- [x] Created a `VercelDeployButton` component that conditionally shows either a "Connect Vercel" button or a "Deploy to Vercel" button
- [x] Implemented a server action for deploying projects to Vercel
- [x] Added proper error handling and user feedback for deployment operations
- [x] Integrated with the session data to detect if a user has connected their Vercel account

### Problem

Users needed a way to deploy projects to Vercel, but the UI didn't guide them through the necessary steps if they hadn't connected their Vercel account yet. This created a confusing experience where deployment attempts would fail without clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.

### Solution

Implemented a smart deployment button that:
1. Checks if the user has connected their Vercel account using session data
2. Shows a "Connect Vercel" button with explanatory text if the account is not connected
3. Shows a "Deploy to Vercel" button if the account is connected
4. Handles the deployment process through a server action with proper error handling
5. Provides clear feedback to the user throughout the process

This implementation:
- Improves the user experience by providing clear guidance
- Reduces failed deployment attempts
- Streamlines the connection and deployment workflow
- Follows the same pattern as the GitHub connection functionality for consistency
- Provides detailed error messages and success notifications
- Opens the Vercel dashboard after successful deployment initiation

# ShipKit AI Development Log

## Authentication Refactoring

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Created `AuthProviderService` to handle auth provider logic on the server side
- [x] Refactored `OAuthButtons` component to accept auth providers as props instead of importing them directly
- [x] Updated `AuthForm` (renamed from `login-form`) to fetch auth providers from the server
- [x] Updated sign-in and sign-up pages to use the new `AuthForm` component
- [x] Implemented Resend magic link authentication
- [x] Implemented Payload CMS credentials authentication
- [x] Fixed Bitbucket provider implementation
- [x] Fixed client/server boundary violation by creating server actions and hooks for auth providers
- [x] Fixed credentials authentication error by correctly passing parameters to NextAuth signIn function
- [x] Fixed NEXT_REDIRECT error by properly handling client-side and server-side redirects
- [x] Fixed authentication result handling to support different response formats

### Authentication Flow

The authentication system now supports multiple providers:

1. OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord, etc.)
2. Magic link authentication via Resend
3. Username/password authentication via Payload CMS

The refactored architecture properly separates server and client components:

- Server components fetch auth provider data using `AuthProviderService`
- Client components use server actions via hooks to access auth provider data
- No server-side code is imported directly into client components

### Client/Server Boundary Fixes

We identified and fixed a client/server boundary violation where client components were directly importing server-only code:

1. Added `server-only` to `AuthProviderService` to prevent client imports
2. Created server actions in `auth-providers.ts` to expose server data to clients
3. Implemented hooks in `use-auth-providers.ts` for client components to access server data
4. Updated `OAuthButtons` to use the hooks instead of direct imports
5. Ensured proper typing throughout the codebase

This approach maintains a clean separation between server and client code while allowing client components to access necessary data from the server.

### Credentials Authentication Fixes

We identified and fixed issues with the credentials authentication flow:

1. Fixed how credentials are passed to the NextAuth `signIn` function
2. Added proper error logging to help diagnose authentication issues
3. Fixed type errors in the `validateCredentials` method
4. Ensured the user ID is returned as a string to match the NextAuth User type
5. Added detailed logging throughout the authentication flow for better debugging

These fixes ensure that users can successfully sign in with their email and password using Payload CMS as the authentication backend.

### NEXT_REDIRECT Error Fixes

We identified and fixed a NEXT_REDIRECT error that was occurring during the authentication flow:

1. Updated the `signInWithCredentialsAction` to set `redirect: false` to prevent automatic server-side redirects
2. Modified the `CredentialsForm` component to handle client-side redirects after successful authentication
3. Added proper error handling and logging to diagnose authentication issues
4. Used the Next.js router for client-side navigation after successful authentication
5. Added a success toast notification to provide feedback to the user

These changes ensure that the authentication flow properly handles redirects and prevents the NEXT_REDIRECT error that was occurring when mixing server-side and client-side redirects.

### Authentication Result Handling Fixes

We identified and fixed issues with how authentication results are handled:

1. Updated the `CredentialsForm` component to handle different result formats from NextAuth
2. Added support for string URL results, which are returned by NextAuth in some cases
3. Improved error handling to provide better feedback to users
4. Updated the sign-up flow to use the same approach as the sign-in flow for consistency
5. Added fallback handling for unexpected result formats to ensure a smooth user experience

These changes ensure that the authentication flow works correctly regardless of the format of the result returned by NextAuth.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all authentication methods
- [ ] Implement user profile management
- [ ] Add account linking functionality (connect multiple auth providers to one account)
- [ ] Implement role-based access control

## Authentication Flow Fixes

### Foreign Key Constraint Error Fix

- [x] Updated `src/server/services/auth-service.ts` to ensure users are created in both Payload CMS and Shipkit databases
- [x] Modified `signUpWithCredentials` to create a user in the Shipkit database after creating in Payload CMS
- [x] Updated `validateCredentials` to ensure users exist in the Shipkit database during sign-in
- [x] Modified the `signIn` callback in `src/server/auth.config.ts` to ensure OAuth users exist in the Shipkit database

This fixes the error: "insert or update on table 'shipkit_team_member' violates foreign key constraint 'shipkit_team_member_user_id_shipkit_user_id_fk'".

The problem was that users created in the Payload CMS database were not being created in the Shipkit database, causing foreign key constraint violations when trying to associate users with teams.

## Session Synchronization Between NextAuth and Payload CMS

- [x] Created a custom hook `useSynchronizedSession` in `src/hooks/use-synchronized-session.ts` to manage sessions across systems
- [x] Implemented a `SessionStatus` component in `src/app/(app)/_components/session-status.tsx` to demonstrate the hook usage
- [x] Added methods to validate Payload CMS tokens and refresh sessions when needed
- [x] Created a refresh-session API route in `src/app/api/auth/refresh-session/route.ts` to handle session refreshes
- [x] Fixed type errors when using database session strategy instead of JWT

### Implementation Details

The session synchronization system consists of several components:

1. **`useSynchronizedSession` Hook**:
   - Provides a unified interface for client components to access authentication state
   - Tracks both NextAuth session and Payload CMS authentication status
   - Offers methods to refresh sessions and validate tokens
   - Simplifies working with dual authentication systems

2. **`SessionStatus` Component**:
   - Demonstrates how to use the `useSynchronizedSession` hook
   - Displays the current authentication status for both systems
   - Provides UI controls to refresh sessions and validate tokens
   - Serves as a reference implementation for other components

3. **Refresh Session API Route**:
   - Handles session refreshes by redirecting to the sign-in page
   - Preserves the current URL as the callback destination
   - Ensures users return to their previous location after re-authentication
   - Logs session refresh attempts for debugging

4. **Database Session Strategy Fixes**:
   - Added type checking for `payloadToken` in session and token objects
   - Updated middleware to handle both JWT and database session strategies
   - Fixed type errors in the session callback
   - Ensured consistent handling of the Payload token across the application
   - Added proper error handling for cases where the token is not a string

This implementation ensures that:
- Client components can easily access authentication state from both systems
- Users remain authenticated in both NextAuth and Payload CMS
- Sessions can be refreshed when tokens expire
- The authentication state is synchronized between the two systems
- Developers have a clear pattern to follow for authentication in client components
- The application works correctly with both JWT and database session strategies

## User Onboarding Flow

- [x] Created an onboarding wizard component to guide users through setting up their Next.js starter kit
- [x] Implemented a multi-step onboarding flow with the following steps:
  - Welcome & Introduction
  - Connect GitHub Account
  - Configure Project Settings
  - Deploy to Vercel
  - Next Steps & Resources
- [x] Added local storage persistence to remember onboarding progress
- [x] Integrated the onboarding flow into the dashboard
- [x] Added ability to skip or complete onboarding

The onboarding flow is designed to help users quickly get started with their purchased Next.js starter kit. It guides them through the essential steps of setting up their project and deploying it to Vercel. The flow is implemented using Shadcn UI components and Framer Motion for smooth transitions between steps.

### Implementation Details

1. **OnboardingWizard Component**: A modal-based wizard that guides users through the setup process
2. **useLocalStorage Hook**: A custom hook to persist onboarding progress in local storage
3. **OnboardingCheck Component**: A component that determines whether to show the onboarding wizard
4. **Dashboard Integration**: The onboarding flow is integrated into the dashboard page

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Add analytics to track onboarding completion rates
- [ ] Implement more interactive elements in the onboarding steps
- [ ] Add ability to revisit onboarding steps after completion
- [ ] Create a dedicated onboarding page for users who want to restart the process
