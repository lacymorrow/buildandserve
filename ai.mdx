# AI Agent Work

This document outlines the work I have done to rebrand the website to "Build and Serve".

## Rebranding Plan

The goal is to rebrand the site to "Build and Serve", a web development agency that builds modern sites and applications with an emphasis on AI features.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Update `page.tsx`**: Added a `NextSteps` component to guide users.
- [x] **Create `next-steps-section.tsx`**: Built a new section to showcase the agency's services, portfolio, and contact information.
- [x] **Update `hero-section.tsx`**: Modified the hero section to reflect the new branding and updated calls-to-action.
- [x] **Update `logo.tsx`**: Replaced the existing SVG logo with a text-based logo for "Build and Serve".
- [x] Fix hydration mismatch in `CaseStudyMarquee` by making `marquee-along-svg-path` path `id` deterministic and SSR-safe using `useId`.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Review and refine the copy across the site to ensure it aligns with the new brand identity.
- [ ] Create dedicated pages for services, portfolio, and contact information.
- [ ] Update any remaining instances of the old branding.

This plan will ensure a consistent and professional rebranding of the website.
