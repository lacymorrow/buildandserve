# Authentication Routes Cleanup

## Issues Identified

- [x] Missing type definitions for form fields in reset-password-form.tsx
- [x] Improper handling of server action response in reset-password-form.tsx
- [ ] Import issues with 'react-hook-form' - need to install or fix module resolution
- [x] Inconsistent error handling across different authentication forms
- [x] Need to standardize form field typing across all auth components
- [x] Potential redundant code in auth implementation

## Completed Fixes

- [x] Added proper type definition (ResetPasswordFormValues) for the reset password form
- [x] Fixed server action response handling in reset-password-form.tsx
- [x] Added proper typing for form field components with ControllerRenderProps
- [x] Updated sign-up-form.tsx to use consistent typing and toast pattern
- [x] Updated forgot-password-form.tsx to use consistent typing and response handling
- [x] Added loading states to buttons when forms are submitting
- [x] Refactored credentials-form.tsx to use signInSchema instead of duplicated schema
- [x] Standardized form setup across all auth forms
- [x] Removed console.log statements for cleaner code

## To Do

- [ ] Fix module resolution for 'react-hook-form' and 'zod' (ignored for now per requirements)
- [ ] Fix field typing in the form render functions to eliminate 'any' type errors

## Implementation Notes

We've standardized the following patterns across authentication forms:

1. **Type Definitions**: Each form has a dedicated type definition using `z.infer<typeof schema>`
   ```typescript
   type ResetPasswordFormValues = z.infer<typeof resetPasswordSchema>;
   ```

2. **Form Hook Setup**: Consistent setup with properly typed generics
   ```typescript
   const form = useForm<FormValues>({
     resolver: zodResolver(schema),
     defaultValues: getSchemaDefaults<typeof schema>(schema),
   });
   ```

3. **Server Action Handling**: All forms now expect consistent response format
   ```typescript
   const result = await action(values);
   if (result.success) {
     // Handle success
   } else {
     // Handle error with result.error
   }
   ```

4. **Toast Notifications**: Standardized to use sonner toast with consistent format
   ```typescript
   toast.success("Success message", { description: "Details..." });
   toast.error("Error message", { description: error || "Default error..." });
   ```

5. **Loading States**: All submit buttons now show loading state
   ```typescript
   <Button disabled={form.formState.isSubmitting}>
     {form.formState.isSubmitting ? "Processing..." : "Submit"}
   </Button>
   ```

These patterns improve consistency, type safety, and user experience across all authentication forms.

## Known Issues

There are still some type-related errors due to missing type declarations for `react-hook-form` and `zod`. These have been documented but not fixed as per the instruction to ignore library imports.
