# Payload CMS

[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) is a self-hosted headless CMS with a powerful admin interface and API. ShipKit integrates Payload CMS for structured content management.

## Configuration

Add these environment variables to enable Payload CMS:

```env
# Required
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your_payload_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url

# Optional - Disable Payload in development
DISABLE_PAYLOAD=true
```

### Generate a Secure Secret

You can use the tool below to generate a secure random string for your `PAYLOAD_SECRET`:

<SecretGenerator label="Generate Payload Secret" />

## Content Structure

Payload CMS in ShipKit is configured with the following collections:

- **Pages**: For creating dynamic pages with flexible layouts
- **Media**: For managing images and other media files
- **Users**: For managing admin users

## Creating Content

1. Access the Payload admin at `/cms`
2. Log in with your admin credentials
3. Navigate to the Pages collection
4. Create a new page with a unique slug
5. Add content blocks to build your page
6. Publish the page when ready

## Accessing Content

Content created in Payload CMS is automatically available at the URL matching its slug:

- A page with slug `about` will be available at `/about`
- A page with slug `products/featured` will be available at `/products/featured`

## Preview Mode

You can preview unpublished content by appending `?preview=true` to the URL when logged into the admin.

## API Access

Payload provides a REST API for programmatic access to your content:

```typescript
// Example: Fetch a page by slug
const page = await payload.find({
  collection: 'pages',
  where: {
    slug: {
      equals: 'about',
    },
  },
});
```
