# Markdown and MDX

ShipKit supports Markdown and MDX for content authoring, providing a developer-friendly way to create and manage content.

## Overview

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted content using plain text. MDX extends Markdown by allowing you to include JSX components directly in your content.

## File Structure

Markdown and MDX files in ShipKit are organized in the `src/content` directory:

```
src/content/
├── docs/            # Documentation content
├── blog/            # Blog posts
src/pages/           # Static pages
```

## Creating Content

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file for metadata
3. Write your content using Markdown syntax
4. For MDX, import and use React components as needed

## Frontmatter

Use frontmatter to define metadata for your content:

```md
---
title: 'My Page Title'
description: 'A brief description of the page'
date: '2023-01-01'
author: 'John Doe'
---

# Content starts here
```

## Using Components in MDX

MDX allows you to import and use React components:

```mdx
---
title: 'Interactive Page'
---

import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

# Interactive Content

Click the button below:

<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## Accessing Content

Content created with Markdown and MDX is automatically available at the URL matching its file path:

- `src/content/pages/about.mdx` will be available at `/about`
- `src/content/blog/hello-world.mdx` will be available at `/blog/hello-world`
