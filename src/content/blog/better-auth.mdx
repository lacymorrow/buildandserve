# ShipKit.io Now Supports `better-auth` 🎉

We're excited to announce that **ShipKit.io** now supports [`better-auth`](https://www.better-auth.com) — a modern authentication library focused on security, simplicity, and seamless integration.

This update is in addition to our existing support for `auth.js`, giving developers the freedom to choose the solution that best fits their stack and workflow.

## Why `better-auth`?

- 🔐 Built-in modern security features
- ⚡️ Fast and lightweight
- 🔧 Developer-friendly API
- 🧩 Easy to integrate with existing ShipKit projects

## Getting Started

To use `better-auth` with ShipKit, check out our updated [docs](https://shipkit.io/docs/authentication) and follow the integration guide.

Whether you're starting a new project or improving an existing one, you now have more flexibility than ever with authentication on ShipKit. Happy shipping 🚀
